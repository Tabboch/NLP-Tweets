NLP analysis of tweets of influencial people

I have constructed a sentiment analysis algorithm over the tweets of influencial people online to show wheteher there exist casuality between the sentiment expressed on those tweets and the related stock price movement. To do so, I have used the spacy library to evaluate sentiment and subjectivity of each tweet. After having gathered and cleaned the data I have constructed my sentiment analysis algorithm and studied its characteristics as a timme series, such as fitting the most appropriate ARMA model
